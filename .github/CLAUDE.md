# .github/ — Claude Code Guidance

## Overview

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows and Dependabot configuration for the next-build-cache composite action.

## Release Workflow (`workflows/release.yml`)

Delegates to the reusable workflow in [`brianespinosa/release-action`](https://github.com/brianespinosa/release-action). All release logic (semver versioning via git-cliff, changelog generation, GitHub release creation, alias tag management, and Dependabot major version PR title rewriting) lives there.

**Semver mapping** (handled by git-cliff via conventional commits):
- `feat` → minor bump
- `fix` → patch bump
- `!` after type/scope (e.g. `feat(ci)!:`) or `BREAKING CHANGE` footer → major bump
- `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `style` → no bump

**REQUIRED: All PRs must be merged via squash merge.** The reusable workflow rewrites Dependabot major-version PR titles from `fix(deps):` to `feat(...)!:` — this only takes effect when squash merging (the PR title becomes the commit message).

## Dependabot (`dependabot.yml`)

- Targets `github-actions` ecosystem only
- Single update entry with `fix(deps):` conventional commit prefix for all updates
- Auto-rebasing is enabled
